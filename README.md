# JavaScript30

Hi!

These are my solutions to Wes Bos’ JavaScript30 Vanilla JS Challenges at [javascript30.com](https://javascript30.com)

My learning methodology throughout these exercises is to watch the video once through and then complete the project without going back to the video, if possible. If I get stuck, I'll research in other ways. In some cases I may check out the video again if I need clarification on the end goal of the challenge.

## Thoughts

At the end of each challenge I am creating a note with any thoughts about the challenge. These notes may include new things I learned, problems I faces and how I solved them, or whatever thoughts I may have.
