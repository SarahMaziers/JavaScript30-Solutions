# JavaScript30

Hi!

These are my solutions to Wes Bos’ JavaScript30 Vanilla JS Challenges at [javascript30.com](https://javascript30.com)

You can view my completed challenges here in this Codepen collection: https://codepen.io/collection/nrjNvY/


## Thoughts

At the end of each challenge I am creating a note with any thoughts about the challenge. These notes may include new things I learned, problems I faces and how I solved them, or whatever thoughts I may have.

### 01 JavaScript Drum Kit – 08.25.2017

One minor thing I felt was missing from the drum kit was the ability to activate any of the drums by clicking on the pad. I solved this by adding an event listener to the click event and setting `playSound` as the callback. Then I modified `playSound` slightly to find the correct key code whether the event was a keydown or click.

In the CSS, I added `pointer-events: none;` to each of the text elements inside the drum pad to prevent them from interrupting the click on the drum pad.


### 02 JS and CSS Clock - 08.26.2017

I started this exercise without looking to see how Wes Bos does it in his video.

My initial solution was to use CSS keyframe animations generated by the JS once on page load. The JavaScript would get the starting clock hands positions from the current time and generate a CSS keyframe animation for each hand based. This method would have had a possible performance advantage because JS would only be executed once on page load instead of every second using a `setInterval` function.

Unfortunately, I discovered that my solution wouldn't keep time accurately because it relied on the the CSS `animation-duration` property to tell each clock hand how much time to take to do a full rotation.

I ended up using a `setInterval` function update the `transform` property of each hand every second based on the current time.
